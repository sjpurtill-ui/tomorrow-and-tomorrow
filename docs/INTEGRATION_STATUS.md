# Current integration checkpoint

Canonical player checkout: `C:/Users/sjpur/TomorrowandTomorrow`, branch `main`.
The OneDrive project is archived. Use `tools/launch_game.ps1` or the existing **Play Tomorrow and Tomorrow** desktop shortcut. The launcher prints the commit it starts. F5 runs the game; F6 may run a preview scene.

## Integrated

- Existing terrain, cities, animated armies, battle generals/carnage/cameras, scouting, military progression, civics, historical people, ambitions and diplomacy: retained from the prior reconciliation through `af76241`.
- Player century focus and council recommendations: `69bc384`, from worker `4967e43`.
- Encounter terrain, opposing contact choreography, clearer battle losses and persistent injured veteran workforce capacity: `3485f1b`, from worker `64d7c7f`.

- Civic and foreign leader conversation continuity: `2dff85c`, from worker `e11302c`; 24 civic context messages, recent decisions, persistent foreign discussions and recoverable failures.
- Scout returns preserve simulation speed and keep reports available for later reading: `cf3a058`. Recruitment outcomes restored to first report page and unused HUD label removed: `4bc66f4`.

## Preserved pending work

- Frontier outposts: uncommitted isolated prototype in `C:/Users/sjpur/tt-frontier-outposts`; explicitly not ready for the game. No autoload, shared state, UI or save hooks are integrated.
- Blender contact clip authoring experiment: preserved in `C:/Users/sjpur/tt-battle-contact-landscape`; missing source blend dependencies prevented export. Existing runtime animation assets remain in use.
- Sliced vegetation: uncommitted, unvalidated prototype in `C:/Users/sjpur/tt-sliced-vegetation`, held outside the player build.
- Older worktrees are retained for traceability. Many commits were cherry-picked/reconciled, so differing hashes do not imply missing features. Do not bulk-merge their old versions.

## Ownership and delivery

One integrator owns main. Every worker starts from the current integrated main in its own `codex/<task>` worktree, reports file ownership, tests, and returns a task-only commit. A worker's preview is not a player release. Update this file and `FEATURE_RECONCILIATION.md` when integration is verified. Keep unfinished prototypes explicit; never claim all planned features shipped.

Preserve saves, existing uncommitted files and active player sessions. A running process may still contain older scripts/state. Save and restart after structural integration; do not kill a live game to make it look current. No automatic folder synchronization or copying from the archived OneDrive tree.

Copy-ready worker instructions are in `docs/WORKER_HANDOFF.md`.

## Verification at this checkpoint

The broad suite ran 522 cases (two skipped). It exposed four assertions in one recruitment-report test and an orphan HUD label. Both causes were fixed. The final combined focused run passed 66 cases with zero errors, failures or orphans (dialogue continuity, 39 UI cases, scout return speed, injuries/geometry and century focus). The earlier broad suite covered century-scale rivals, billion-population bounded state and military accounting. It was not rerun in full after the isolated fixes.

Actual save/load, opening/century renewal, GPU battle graphics and foreign diplomacy probes passed. The offline pronouncement probe now explicitly disables API access for its offline cases and passes. Worker HTTP failure/retry and four live Terra conversation turns passed before integration. Engine shutdown still reports two ObjectDB instances and one resource in the final save probe; no clean shutdown claim is made.

Revised battle demo was visibly replayed from canonical main and verified via a fresh screenshot. It is explicitly labeled BATTLE DEMONSTRATION. The separate campaign process and editor were preserved. Save and restart the campaign through the canonical launcher to load all integrated structural changes.

## Latest visual refinement

Integrated `1af3fbe` from `codex/battle-planted`: fighters stay planted after approach, use varied guarded weapon strikes and small upper-body hit reactions instead of reciprocal whole-body sliding. A 100-frame/five-second GPU temporal probe measured zero root drift while attack and guard poses changed; the battle graphics regression passed. No casualty, population or save rules changed.
